Original dataset can be found here. The main difference between original and this dataset is that I placed each category of food in separate folder to make model training process more convenient.

This dataset contains 16643 food images grouped in 11 major food categories.

There are 3 splits in this dataset:

evaluation

training

validation

Each split contains 11 categories of food:

Bread

Dairy product

Dessert

Egg

Fried food

Meat

Noodles-Pasta

Rice
